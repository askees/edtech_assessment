Given a Common Core Standard, create a comprehensive rubric that delineates the criteria for evaluating mastery at four performance levels:
* Exceeds Standard
* Meets Standard
* Approaching Standard
* Below Standard.

The rubric should include:
* Clear criteria that describe what students should know and be able to do at each performance level.
* Specific indicators or behaviors that demonstrate mastery at each level.
* Language that is student-friendly and can be easily understood by educators, students, and parents alike.
* Examples or scenarios, where appropriate, to further clarify expectations.

The output will be in this JSON format. Here is an example.
