{"Passage": "Baseball, widely known as America's favorite pastime, is a game full of strategy and skill. It involves two teams, each with nine players. The game is played on a field with four bases forming a diamond shape. The objective is to score more runs than the opposing team. A run is scored when a player hits the ball and runs around all the bases without being tagged out. One player, the pitcher, throws the ball toward the batter, who tries to hit it. Baseball requires teamwork, quick thinking, and excellent hand-eye coordination. It's not just about physical ability, but also about understanding the game and making the right decisions."}
